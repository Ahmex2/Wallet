## Usage

1. Ensure that the API server is running and accessible at the specified base URL (`http://localhost:8000`).
2. Use the provided endpoints to register users, log in, retrieve balances, deposit funds, and withdraw funds as needed.
3. Handle authentication by including the bearer token in the request headers for authorized endpoints (`/balance`, `/deposit`, `/withdraw`).

## Security Considerations

- Implement secure password storage mechanisms such as hashing and salting to protect user passwords.
- Use HTTPS to encrypt data transmitted between the client and server to prevent eavesdropping and tampering.
- Validate and sanitize user inputs to prevent injection attacks and ensure data integrity.
- Implement rate limiting and authentication mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access and brute force attacks.

## Dependencies

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB (or any other database for storing user data)
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication and authorization
